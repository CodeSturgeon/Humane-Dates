Easy boilerplate for test driven JavaScript projects using the JsTestDriver tool.

Project goals include:

 * Provide instant JavaScript testing for any project.
 * Where possible, test browsers are isolated from currently executing
   browsers and close when tests are finished.
 
Usage:

 * Step 1: To set up permissions and create browser profiles, run
      ant install

 * Step 2: To run all of the tests in src-test/*.js using your
   source code from src/*.js (Configurable in jsTestDriver.conf)
      ant

The default config is setup for for MacOS, would be happy to merge a
working config for Windows.
