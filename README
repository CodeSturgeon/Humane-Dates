A better way to display relative dates using JavaScript. Instead of a raw date
string, this script will return strings like "2 hours ago" or "5 days".


JavaScript Usage: (returns string)

  humaneDate(new Date);
  humaneDate('2008-01-28T20:24:17Z');


jQuery Plugin Usage: (sets HTML of elements)

  <span class="humaneDate" title="2008-01-28T20:24:17Z">January 1, 2008 20:24:17 GMT</span>

  $('span.humaneDate').humaneDates();


To run the full test suite:
  ant install
  ant

=======
Easy boilerplate for test driven JavaScript projects using the JsTestDriver tool.

Project goals include:

 * Provide instant JavaScript testing for any project.
 * Where possible, test browsers are isolated from currently executing
   browsers and close when tests are finished.
 
Usage:

 * Step 1: To set up permissions and create browser profiles, run
      ant install

 * Step 2: To run all of the tests in src-test/*.js using your
   source code from src/*.js (Configurable in jsTestDriver.conf)
      ant

The default config is setup for MacOS, would be happy to merge a
working config for Windows.
